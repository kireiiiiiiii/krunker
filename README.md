## 🌌 Features

- Clean, simple, white style
- Custom PNG damage & game overlays
- Stylish in-game UI tweaks

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Custom CSS**

   - Install the **[Stylus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)** Chrome extension, using this we can override the Krunker css file
   - Also download the **[stylus.json](./stylus.json)** file
   - Go to a new Chrome tab, than to the top right corner, there should be a puzzle piece icon, that is where you can manage extensions
   - Click on the Stylus extension, and when a little window pops up, click on **Manage**
   - On the right side of the site that just opened there should be an **Import** button. Click it and select the file you downloaded
   - Congrats, you installed the custom css! 🥳

2. **Settings (& overlays)**

   - Open [Krunker](krunker.io)
   - Click the **gear icon** in the bottom right to open settings
   - On the top right, there should be a slider with **Basic** written in it. Toggle it, so it says **Advanced**
   - Go to the [settings.txt](./settings.txt) file, and copy it to your clipboard
   - On the top of settings in Krunker there should be an import button. Click it and paste the text from the file here
   - Click the import button
   - You imported the settings! The overlays should work too 🥳
