   - Also download the **[stylus.json](./stylus.json)** file
   - Go to a new Chrome tab, than to the top right corner, there should be a puzzle piece icon, that is where you can manage extensions
   - Click on the Stylus extension, and when a little window pops up, click on **Manage**
   - On the right side of the site that just opened there should be an **Import** button. Click it and select the file you downloaded
   - Congrats, you installed the custom css!
